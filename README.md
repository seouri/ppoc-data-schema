# PPOC Pediatric EHR Data Package

This repository describes eight de-identified pediatric EHR CSV resources with a machine-readable [Frictionless Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/) descriptor. The data uses `patient_id` for patient-level linkage, and absolute dates are represented as patient age in days.

[The Pediatric Physicians’ Organization at Children’s (PPOC)](https://www.ppochildrens.org/) is an independent pediatric physician association and primary-care network affiliated with Boston Children’s Hospital, serving practices across Massachusetts. This data is provided by PPOC to the Isaac Kohane Lab in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard Medical School under an IRB protocol and Data Use Agreement.

## Contents

- [`datapackage.json`](datapackage.json): field types, nullability, constraints, keys, encodings, and resource metadata.
- [`docs/data_description.md`](docs/data_description.md): dataset overview, relationships, and analysis guidance.
- [`docs/`](docs/): resource-specific field descriptions.
- [`schema/README.md`](schema/README.md): Python loading examples.
- [`schema/build.py`](schema/build.py): regenerate and validate `datapackage.json`.
- [`schema/profile.py`](schema/profile.py): recompute the snapshot statistics from the CSVs.
- [`schema/stats.json`](schema/stats.json): the statistics `build.py` reads, so the descriptor rebuilds without the data.

## Resources

| Resource | Rows | Fields | Description |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| [`patients.csv`](docs/patients.md) | 250,588 | 11 | Patient demographics |
| [`patients_augmented.csv`](docs/patients_augmented.md) | 250,588 | 87 | Patient-level growth and diagnosis summaries |
| [`visits.csv`](docs/visits.md) | 6,494,473 | 43 | Visit-level measurements and diagnoses |
| [`visits_augmented-20251209150512.csv`](docs/visits_augmented.md) | 6,494,473 | 82 | Visit-level derived growth metrics and flags |
| [`labs.csv`](docs/labs.md) | 17,230,681 | 12 | Laboratory result components |
| [`medications.csv`](docs/medications.md) | 3,823,049 | 8 | Medication records |
| [`problem_list.csv`](docs/problem_list.md) | 1,709,584 | 5 | Problem-list entries |
| [`referrals.csv`](docs/referrals.md) | 349,827 | 6 | Specialty referrals |

The package expects these CSVs beside `datapackage.json`. To keep the descriptor in this repository while reading CSVs from another directory, set `PPOC_DATA_ROOT` for the Python example in [`schema/README.md`](schema/README.md).

## Relationships

- `patients.csv` and `patients_augmented.csv` contain one row per `patient_id`.
- `visits.csv` and `visits_augmented-20251209150512.csv` contain `patient_id` and `visit_id`.
- `labs.csv`, `medications.csv`, and `referrals.csv` link to patients through `patient_id`; their `visit_id` values are nullable and may not match a visit row.
- `problem_list.csv` links to patients through `patient_id` and has no direct visit key.

Use the `foreignKeys` and `x-logicalForeignKeys` entries in `datapackage.json` for the declared join relationships and their row-level link statistics.

## Validate or regenerate the descriptor

From the repository root:

```sh
python3 schema/build.py
python3 schema/build.py --check
```

Every count, range, and value distribution in the descriptor is measured from the
CSV snapshot rather than maintained by hand. After the data changes, re-measure
with the DuckDB CLI on `PATH` and rebuild:

```sh
python3 schema/profile.py --data-root /path/to/csvs --snapshot 2026-08-24
python3 schema/build.py
```

The Python usage example includes schema-driven pandas loading, declared CSV encodings, nullable types, column selection, and key inspection.

## Synthetic fixture implementation

The approved design is in [the synthetic growth fixture specification](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-synthetic-growth-fixtures-design.md). The first implementation work package establishes an exact-schema synthetic smoke-profile package with injected growth-reference and augmentation interfaces. It does not ship a clinically validated reference model, claim demographic representativeness, calibrate or validate prevalence, read PPOC records, or establish privacy or release approval.

Until the authoritative augmentation implementation or an approved parity harness is supplied, the command-line entry point fails closed. The smoke-profile package must not be labeled a development fixture, golden fixture, or validated output.

See [`docs/synthetic-generator.md`](docs/synthetic-generator.md) for the Python usage example, output contract, safety checks, and verification commands.
